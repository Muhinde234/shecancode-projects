# JavaScript Fundamentals Assignment

This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript fundamental problems covering string manipulations, array operations, object transformations, and higher-order functions.

## Features

- **String Transformations**: Capitalization, reversing, palindrome checking, word counting, case conversion, and more.
- **Array Operations**: Doubling elements, filtering evens, summing, averaging, finding min/max, removing duplicates.
- **Object Manipulations**: Working with person objects, filtering by age, adding properties, counting properties.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Function composition, array transformations, sorting, filtering, and caching.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the functions you need into your JavaScript project
3. Use them according to the documentation above

## Examples

```javascript
// String example
const reversedCap = reverseAndCapitalize("hello"); // "Olleh"

// Array example
const doubledEvens = doubleEvens([1, 2, 3, 4]); // [4, 8]

// Object example
const people = [{name: "Dositha", age: 25}, {name: "muhinde", age: 17}];
const adults = filterByAge(people, 18);
